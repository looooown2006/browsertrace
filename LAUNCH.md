## Owner-Only Actions

Codex can prepare assets, update the repo, write copy, audit links, and monitor GitHub. The owner must personally do these actions because they require platform login, 2FA, or human conversation:

- PyPI first publish is completed. Future PyPI releases should use the manual
  `Publish` workflow after the version and release artifacts are ready.
- Keep the live `aaronlab/aaronlab` GitHub profile repository aligned with
  `docs/launch/github-profile-readme.md`.
- Profile pin is completed: BrowserTrace (`aaronlab/browsertrace`) is pinned on
  the public GitHub profile during launch.
- GitHub social preview is completed. Keep `docs/social-preview.png` as the
  reusable source asset for future launch previews.
- Submit `https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/sitemap.xml` in Google Search
  Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.
- Monitor the thirteen open third-party awesome-list and directory PRs plus the
  CLIs.dev submission issue, and respond only if maintainers ask for changes.
  Do not open additional list PRs unless the target is clearly high-fit and
  non-duplicative.
- Publish X, LinkedIn, WeChat, Jike, Xiaohongshu, Reddit, Discord, and community posts.
- Submit Show HN from a real Hacker News account and reply in your own voice.
- Create or schedule the Product Hunt draft from a personal Product Hunt account.
- Reply to launch comments where a real personal answer is expected.

## Daily Metrics

Run this audit at the start and end of each launch day:

```bash
uv run --python 3.11 python scripts/launch_metrics.py --append --note "start of launch day"
uv run --python 3.11 python scripts/launch_metrics.py --json
```

Record owner-post URLs and qualitative feedback next to the metrics row in
`docs/launch/metrics-log.md`. Check open feedback separately when triaging:

```bash
gh issue list --repo aaronlab/browsertrace --state all --limit 20
gh api repos/aaronlab/browsertrace/discussions --jq '.[].html_url'
```

Current latest audit:

| Captured at | Stars | To 1001 | Forks | Watchers | Issues | PRs | Release downloads | Note |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 2026-05-11T04:34:41+00:00 | 3 | 998 | 12 | 0 | 11 | 0 | 26 | current monitor pass after targeted Stagehand custom-tool replay/cache technical reply: https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/issues/1558#issuecomment-4417618622; adapter research note: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/8#issuecomment-4417619466; star goal remains incomplete; traffic views 112/41 unique, clones 5965/1214 unique |

The active objective is incomplete until `stargazerCount > 1000`.

## Launch Gates

Hacker News:

- Use the repo URL as the submission URL.
- Title must start with `Show HN:`.
- People must be able to try the project without signup or email.
- Do not ask friends to upvote or comment.
- Avoid generated comment replies; use the templates only as notes and answer in your own voice.

Product Hunt:

- Use a personal account, not a company account.
- Primary URL should be the product page or repo, not a press article.
- Prepare tagline, gallery, description, maker comment, and demo before scheduling.
- It is fine to share the launch link, but ask people to visit, try, or comment, not to upvote.

Reddit and Discord:

- Check each community's rules before posting.
- Prefer a useful debugging write-up over a direct link drop.
- Post in one or two highly relevant communities, not many generic ones.
