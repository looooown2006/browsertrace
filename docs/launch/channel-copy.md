## AOS Mapping Research

Use this when someone asks whether BrowserTrace maps to OWASP AOS.
BrowserTrace is not an AOS compliance claim yet. Current research maps the
closest BrowserTrace concepts to tool request/result records, step correlation,
URI-style screenshot/video artifacts, URL metadata, model I/O summaries, and
explicit redaction state.

Tracker: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/237

## Artifact Boundary Reply

Use this when someone is debugging screenshot blobs, base64 payloads, oversized
tool results, or model-context pollution in browser-agent runs.

```text
The pattern that has worked best for BrowserTrace is to keep browser artifacts
and model messages separate:

1. Store screenshots, URLs, and trace data as local artifacts for humans.
2. Pass image pixels to the model only when that next model call needs a typed
   image content block.
3. Otherwise pass small metadata: artifact id, dimensions, digest, status, and
   error.

That avoids stuffing large screenshots or data URIs into every future model
turn, while still keeping the failed browser state available for debugging.
For public sharing, `browsertrace export --public` omits prompt/model I/O,
screenshots, and URLs.
```

## Fresh Browser Use Debugging Angle

Use this after the icon-only Browser Use failure write-up is live. It is a
technical story, not a launch ask.

Short post:

```text
Fresh Browser Use debugging note:

If the screenshot shows a plus icon but the agent clicks a nearby toolbar button, treat it as a visible-target vs accessible-target mismatch.

Capture: live HTML, accessibility snapshot, candidate boxes, and the clicked element.
```

Follow-up with link:

```text
Guide: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/browser-use-debugging.html

Durable fix: put an accessible name on the real button, e.g. aria-label="Create Test".

BrowserTrace keeps the failed-step timeline local so screenshot, URL, action, and model output stay inspectable.
```

## Fresh Browser Use Remote CDP Angle

Use this for Browser Use, Browserless, remote-CDP, and pooled-browser users.
It is a technical debugging note, not a launch ask.

Short post:

```text
Fresh Browser Use debugging note:

Remote CDP failures are not always screenshot failures.

A stale remote browser session can keep the websocket open while one CDP request never returns. If recovery holds a global event-bus lock, one bad session can block unrelated sessions.
```

Follow-up with link:

```text
The evidence I would capture for this class of bug:

- event id + browser/session/target id
- CDP method/request id/duration
- websocket ping/pong near the stuck request
- event-bus lock wait/acquire/release timing
- whether recovery waited while holding the lock
```

```text
BrowserTrace is trying to make these browser-agent failure boundaries inspectable instead of hiding them in logs.

Guide: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/browser-use-debugging.html
```

## Fresh Computer-Use Persistent Browser Recovery Angle

Use this for custom computer-use agents, persistent browser profiles, and local
browser session recovery failures. It is a technical debugging note, not a
launch ask.

Short post:

```text
Fresh computer-use debugging note:

Persistent browser failures often happen before any screenshot exists.

Do not trust profile lock files or process names alone. Capture session_mode, redacted profile id, CDP attach/probe timing, recovery action, and final connection state.
```

Follow-up with link:

```text
Trace before the page opens:

- profile selection + session_mode
- lock/stale-process signal
- CDP attach/probe timing
- approval source + recovery action
- final connection state

Guide: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/computer-use-agent-debugging.html
```

## Fresh Chinese Computer-Use Recovery Angle

Use this for WeChat, Jike, or Chinese AI-builder groups when the audience is
building custom computer-use agents or persistent browser sessions.

```text
最近遇到一个 browser agent 调试点：有些失败发生在第一张截图之前。

比如 persistent browser session 复用失败，profile lock 或进程名看起来像线索，但不一定可信。真正需要记录的是：

- session_mode
- redacted profile id
- CDP attach/probe timing
- recovery action
- final connection state

我在 BrowserTrace 里把这个 failure shape 写成了 computer-use 调试指南，想听听做 browser agent / computer-use agent 的人：你们遇到过哪些 session recovery 问题？

I want feedback from people building browser agents: what state should a trace capture when a run fails?
```

## LinkedIn

```text
I built BrowserTrace, an open-source local debugger for AI browser agents.

The problem: when a browser agent fails, normal logs usually miss the actual browser state. You know a tool call happened, but not what the model saw, which URL it was on, which screenshot led to the decision, or where the first wrong assumption entered the run.

BrowserTrace records each step as a local timeline:

- Screenshot
- URL
- Action
- Model input/output
- Step status and error
- Exportable HTML trace, with a redacted sharing mode

It is MIT licensed, local-first, and designed for Browser Use, Stagehand, Playwright + LLM scripts, and custom computer-use agents.

Live demo: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/
Repo: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace

I am looking for feedback from people debugging real browser-agent runs. What should it record that your current logs miss?

Show HN: BrowserTrace - record and replay AI browser-agent runs to find bugs
```

First comment draft, to edit in the owner's own voice before posting:

```text
Hi HN,

I've been building browser-using AI agents and kept hitting the same debugging loop: a multi-minute run fails, the logs show tool calls, but I cannot see what the agent actually saw at the browser step where things went wrong.

Another failure class happens even earlier: persistent browser recovery can fail before any screenshot exists. For that, profile lock files are not enough; I want session_mode, redacted profile id, CDP attach/probe timing, recovery action, and final connection state in the trace.

BrowserTrace is a small Python library plus local web UI that records each browser-agent step: screenshot, URL, action, model input, model output, status, and error. You open localhost:3000, click the run, and jump to the failed step.

It is intentionally local-first:
- no signup
- no cloud
- SQLite plus filesystem
- MIT licensed
- works with Browser Use, Stagehand, Playwright + LLM scripts, and custom computer-use agents

The repo has a no-API deterministic demo and a live exported HTML trace if you want to inspect the output before installing anything:
https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/

No-install PyPI uvx path:
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui]" browsertrace doctor
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui]" browsertrace demo
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui]" browsertrace

I'd like feedback from people who are building or testing browser agents. What browser state do you wish your current traces captured?

Maker comment:

```text
I built BrowserTrace after losing too much time debugging browser-agent failures from logs alone.

The agent would fail at step 47, but by then the browser was gone. I could see which code ran, but not what the model saw, clicked, or returned.

Some failures happen before the first page screenshot too: persistent browser recovery, profile lock state, CDP attach/probe timing, and whether the agent reused, attached, reset, or fell back to an isolated session.

BrowserTrace keeps the missing context locally:
- screenshots
- URLs
- actions
- model input/output
- failed-step errors
- exportable HTML traces, including `--public` for public sharing

It is MIT licensed and designed for Browser Use, Stagehand, Playwright + LLM scripts, and custom computer-use agents.

I would especially like feedback from people running browser agents in tests or production. What would make this useful in your workflow?

How are you debugging browser-agent failures when logs do not show screenshots?
```

Body:

```text
I have been running into a specific debugging problem with browser agents:

The agent fails deep into a run. Logs show tool calls and exceptions, but the browser state is gone. I cannot see what the model saw, which screenshot led to the action, or where the first wrong assumption happened.

I built a small OSS tool for this called BrowserTrace. It records a local timeline for each step:

- screenshot
- URL
- action
- model input/output
- status and error

It is local-first, MIT licensed, and works with Browser Use, Stagehand, Playwright + LLM scripts, and custom computer-use agents.

I am mainly looking for workflow feedback: if you are building browser agents, what context do you need at failure time that your current logs do not capture?

我做了一个开源小工具 BrowserTrace，给做 browser agent 的人 debug 用。

痛点是：agent 跑到一半挂了，日志只告诉你代码调用了什么，但看不到当时浏览器页面、截图、URL、模型输入输出，所以很难知道它到底在哪一步想错了。

BrowserTrace 会本地记录每一步：
- 截图
- URL
- action
- model input/output
- 错误步骤

本地跑，不上云，MIT 开源。

Live demo: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/
GitHub: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace

如果你在用 Browser Use / Stagehand / Playwright + LLM / computer use，想听听你觉得还应该记录什么。
```

```text
最近做了一个开源工具 BrowserTrace：AI browser agent 的本地飞行记录仪。

以前 browser agent 挂了，只能看一堆 log，很难知道它当时看到了什么、为什么点错、哪一步开始偏了。

BrowserTrace 会把每一步录成 timeline：截图、URL、动作、模型输入输出、错误信息。打开本地 UI 就能直接跳到失败步骤。

适合 Browser Use / Stagehand / Playwright + LLM / computer-use agent。

Live demo: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/
