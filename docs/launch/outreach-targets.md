# BrowserTrace Outreach Targets

Post only where the community rules allow it. The ask is feedback from people building browser agents, not votes or stars.

## Priority Order

1. X, LinkedIn, WeChat, and Jike for quick warm feedback.
2. Hacker News once the first-run path is clearly understandable.
3. Browser Use and Stagehand communities because they match the product.
4. Reddit only with a useful write-up and after checking local rules.
5. Directory/newsletter submissions after `v0.1.14` links are stable. Use
   `docs/launch/directory-submission-sheet.md` as the queue.
6. Product Hunt after the visual assets are strong enough for a broader audience.

## Directory And Newsletter Pitch

Use this for directories and newsletters that accept new tool suggestions. Keep
the subject concrete and do not ask for stars.

Subject:

```text
BrowserTrace: local flight recorder for AI browser agents
```

Body:

```text
BrowserTrace is an MIT-licensed local debugger for AI browser agents.

It records each browser-agent step as a timeline with screenshots, URL, action,
model input/output, status, and errors, then exports a standalone HTML trace.
The v0.1.14 release includes `browsertrace demo` for first-run onboarding,
`browsertrace export --public` for public-safe sharing, and individual
redaction flags when users want to keep some fields visible.

Try locally before PyPI publishing is enabled:

```bash
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace doctor
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace demo
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace
```

Useful for Browser Use, Stagehand, Skyvern, Playwright + LLM scripts, and custom
computer-use agents.

Repo: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace
Live demo: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/
Public-safe demo export: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/releases/download/v0.1.14/browsertrace-demo-public.html
Browser Use guide: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/browser-use-debugging.html
Release: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/releases/tag/v0.1.14
```

Submission notes:

- Submit only once per directory/newsletter.
- If a directory requires an account, use the owner's account.
- If a directory has no visible submission form, use this as an owner email or
  contact-form pitch.
- Track every submission URL or email target in `docs/launch/metrics-log.md`.
- For community replies, share the live walkthrough first. Use the GitHub `uvx`
  command only when someone asks how to run it locally before PyPI publishing is
  enabled.

## Contribution Reply

Use this when someone asks for a small first contribution:

Good first issue:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/192

First PR Recipe:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#first-pr-recipe keeps the first contribution small and reviewable.

## Troubleshooting Reply

For local first-run issues, CI failures, or AI/coding-agent troubleshooting replies, ask for debugging/workflow details plus JSON CLI diagnostics when safe to share:

```bash
browsertrace doctor --json
browsertrace list --status failed --json
browsertrace show <run_id> --json
```

## First Targeted Community Posts

Use these only after the Day 1 warm posts have a live demo link and at least one
real reply or question to reference.

1. Browser Use Discussions
   - Best angle: "I am building a local trace viewer for failed browser-use runs
     and want feedback on which fields matter at failure time."
   - Link order: Browser Use guide first, live trace second, repo third.
   - Feedback sink: `https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/11`
   - Best category: Show and tell or Q&A. Existing threads about selectors,
     generated Playwright scripts, and audit trails are relevant only if the
     reply directly answers the thread.
   - Do not open a Browser Use issue unless reporting an actual Browser Use bug
     or proposing a concrete adapter.
2. Stagehand Discussions or Discord
   - Best angle: "For Stagehand + Playwright scripts, would a local timeline of
     screenshots, URLs, actions, and model I/O make failure triage easier?"
   - Link order: Stagehand guide first, live trace second, repo third.
   - Feedback sink: `https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/8`
   - Ask whether a first-class Stagehand wrapper should capture `act`,
     `extract`, `observe`, or `agent` calls first.
3. Playwright community
   - Best angle: "This is for Playwright scripts that include LLM decisions, not
     a replacement for Playwright trace viewer."
   - Link order: Playwright + LLM guide first, live trace second, repo third.
   - Link to the Playwright + LLM feedback issue if asked for a tracking thread.
   - Use Discord or LinkedIn only when the topic is LLM-guided automation.
     Share only the debugging write-up unless people ask for the repo.
4. Skyvern Discussions
   - Best angle: "I am planning a Skyvern adapter and want to know which failure
     artifacts are most useful: screenshots, step prompts, model outputs, or
     workflow state."
   - Link order: Skyvern guide first, live trace second, repo third.
   - Link to the existing BrowserTrace Skyvern adapter issue if asked for a
     tracking thread.

## Do Not Do

- Do not mass-post the same link to many communities.
- Do not DM strangers asking for stars.
- Do not ask for upvotes on Hacker News or Product Hunt.
- Do not post in communities where self-promotion is disallowed.
- Do not use generated replies verbatim on Hacker News.
