# BrowserTrace Day 3 Targeted Communities Packet

Use this after Day 1 warm posts and only if the owner can reply to technical
questions. The goal is to reach builders who already work with browser agents,
not to post a generic product announcement.

Entry points checked:

- Browser Use Discussions: https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/discussions
- Stagehand Discussions: https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/discussions
- Stagehand Discord: https://discord.gg/stagehand
- Playwright community: https://playwright.dev/community/welcome
- Skyvern Discussions: https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern/discussions
- AgentKart submit: https://www.agentkart.ai/submit
- console.dev: https://console.dev/

## Preflight Gate

Run:

```bash
uv run --python 3.11 python scripts/launch_metrics.py --append --note "before Day 3 targeted communities"
```

Submit only if all are true:

- The owner can reply to technical questions the same day.
- The post asks for adapter/workflow feedback, not stars.
- The post is customized to the community and does not look cross-posted.
- The post uses the walkthrough or live demo before asking people to install.
- If someone asks how to try it locally before PyPI publishing is enabled, use
  the GitHub `uvx` path:

```bash
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace doctor
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace demo
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace
```

- The public-safe demo export is used when someone asks for a downloadable
  artifact that omits prompts, model output, screenshots, and URLs.
- The community allows this kind of post or there is an existing relevant thread.

Do not post if:

- The only available angle is "please check out my repo."
- The community rules prohibit self-promotion.
- There is already a similar unanswered post from the owner.
- The owner cannot follow up.

## Priority Order

1. Browser Use Discussions
2. Stagehand Discussions or Discord
3. Playwright community channels
4. Skyvern Discussions
5. Directory/newsletter submissions that do not require community discussion

Stop after one or two posts if the replies are low quality or negative. Improve
the message before posting anywhere else.

## Browser Use

Best place: GitHub Discussions, preferably a Show and tell, Ideas, or Q&A-style
thread if the category is available.

Title:

```text
Feedback wanted: local traces for failed Browser Use runs
```

Body:

```text
I'm building BrowserTrace, a small local trace viewer for browser-agent failures:
screenshots, URL, action, model input/output, status, and failed-step errors in
one timeline.

The debugging problem I want to solve for Browser Use users is: the agent fails
deep into a run, but the logs do not show what the browser looked like or which
model output caused the wrong action.

Browser Use guide:
https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/browser-use-debugging.html

Live exported trace:
https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/trace.html

Repo:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace

Browser Use adapter feedback issue:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/11

For Browser Use specifically, what would be most useful to capture?

- Agent task and step number
- Browser screenshot
- URL
- Action/tool call
- Model input and output
- Selector or target element
- DOM/extracted text
- Retry state or memory

I'm trying to decide what the Browser Use adapter should capture first.
```

Metrics:

```bash
uv run --python 3.11 python scripts/launch_metrics.py --append --note "after Browser Use discussion: <URL>"
```

## Stagehand

Best place: GitHub Discussions or Stagehand Discord, where allowed.

Title:

```text
Would a local timeline help debug failed Stagehand act/extract runs?
```

Body:

```text
I'm building BrowserTrace, a local debugger for AI browser-agent runs. It records
each step as a timeline: screenshot, URL, action, model input/output, status,
and error.

For Stagehand users, I'm trying to understand which calls are most important to
wrap first:

- act()
- extract()
- observe()
- agent()
- lower-level Playwright page actions

Stagehand guide:
https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/stagehand-debugging.html

Stagehand adapter feedback issue:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/8

If you have debugged a failed Stagehand run, what state did you wish you had at
failure time?
```

Metrics:

```bash
uv run --python 3.11 python scripts/launch_metrics.py --append --note "after Stagehand post: <URL>"
```

## Playwright

Playwright is broader than AI agents. Do not present BrowserTrace as a
replacement for Playwright Trace Viewer. Share only where the question is about
LLM-guided browser automation, agents, or missing model-decision context.

Best angles:

- Playwright + LLM scripts
- Browser tests where an LLM chooses the next action
- Debugging screenshots plus model output
- Exporting a standalone failure trace for an issue

Short reply for relevant threads:

```text
If the missing piece is the LLM decision context rather than Playwright's browser
trace itself, I'm building a small local tool for that case:

Playwright + LLM guide:
https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/playwright-llm-debugging.html

Live exported trace:
https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/trace.html

Repo:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace

Playwright + LLM feedback issue:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/12

It records screenshot, URL, action label, model input/output, and failed-step
error into a local timeline. It is not a replacement for Playwright Trace Viewer;
it is for Playwright scripts where an LLM is part of the control loop.
```

Metrics:

```bash
uv run --python 3.11 python scripts/launch_metrics.py --append --note "after Playwright community reply: <URL>"
```

## Skyvern

Best place: GitHub Discussions, or a relevant adapter/workflow thread. Do not
hijack unrelated bug reports.

Title:

```text
Feedback wanted: what should a Skyvern trace adapter capture?
```

Body:

```text
I'm building BrowserTrace, a local timeline/debugger for failed AI browser-agent
runs. It records screenshots, URL, action, model input/output, status, and
failed-step errors.

BrowserTrace now has a basic Skyvern wrapper for high-level task/workflow calls.
I want to know what a deeper adapter should capture to debug failed workflows:

- screenshots
- workflow state
- task prompt
- model output
- selected element or selector
- browser URL
- retry/history state
- extracted data

Skyvern guide:
https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/skyvern-debugging.html

Live exported trace:
https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/trace.html

Repo:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace

Skyvern adapter feedback issue:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/4

Which artifacts would be most useful when a Skyvern workflow fails?
```

Metrics:

```bash
uv run --python 3.11 python scripts/launch_metrics.py --append --note "after Skyvern discussion: <URL>"
```

## Directories And Newsletters

Use these after `v0.1.14` because the release has the packaged demo command and
safer redacted export path.

Best targets:

- AgentKart: open-source AI agent marketplace submission.
- AgDex: AI agent tools directory; developer tools and observability is the best
  category fit.
- Agent Hub: agent/MCP/skill directory; use only if they accept tool suggestions.
- agentfirst.directory: agent-first tooling directory with a Browser Automation
  category.
- console.dev: devtools newsletter; send an editorial pitch only once.

Pitch:

```text
BrowserTrace is an MIT local debugger for AI browser agents. It records each
Browser Use / Stagehand / Skyvern / Playwright + LLM step as a timeline:
screenshot, URL, action, model input/output, status, and error.

The v0.1.14 release includes `browsertrace demo` for first-run onboarding,
`browsertrace export --public` for public-safe sharing, and individual
redaction flags when users want to keep some fields visible.

Try locally before PyPI publishing is enabled:

```bash
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace doctor
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace demo
```

Repo: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace
Live demo: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/
Public-safe demo export: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/releases/download/v0.1.14/browsertrace-demo-public.html
Browser Use guide: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/browser-use-debugging.html
Release: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/releases/tag/v0.1.14
```

Metrics:

```bash
uv run --python 3.11 python scripts/launch_metrics.py --append --note "after directory/newsletter submission: <target or URL>"
```

## Triage After Posting

Within 24 hours:

- Convert specific adapter requests into GitHub issues.
- Link each issue from the relevant discussion reply.
- Add useful quotes or summaries to `docs/launch/metrics-log.md`.
- Update the v0.2 milestone if a clear adapter priority emerges.
- For local first-run issues, CI failures, or AI/coding-agent troubleshooting replies, ask for debugging/workflow details plus JSON CLI diagnostics when safe to share:

```bash
browsertrace doctor --json
browsertrace list --status failed --json
browsertrace show <run_id> --json
```

- For small first contributions, start with the current good first issue:
  https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/178
  Then link the First PR Recipe:
  https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#first-pr-recipe keeps the first contribution small and reviewable.

## Stop Rules

- Do not post in more than two targeted communities on the same day unless
  replies are clearly useful.
- Do not paste identical text across communities.
- Do not argue with moderators or community regulars.
- Do not ask for stars, upvotes, follows, reposts, or "support."
- If a post is removed, do not repost it; learn from the reason and move on.
