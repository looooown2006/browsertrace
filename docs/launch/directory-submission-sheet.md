## Try-It Commands

Use the PyPI `uvx` path first in directory replies when an editor asks how to try the project:

```bash
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui]" browsertrace doctor
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui]" browsertrace demo
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui]" browsertrace list
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui]" browsertrace
```

Persistent install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install "browsertrace[ui]"
browsertrace demo
browsertrace
```

## One-Line Pitch

BrowserTrace is a local flight recorder for AI browser agents: screenshots,
URLs, actions, model input/output, status, errors, and standalone HTML exports
for failed Browser Use, Stagehand, Skyvern, Playwright + LLM, and computer-use
runs.

## Short Submission Description

BrowserTrace is an MIT-licensed local debugger for AI browser agents. It records
each browser-agent step as a timeline with screenshot, URL, action, model
input/output, status, and error, then exports a standalone HTML trace with
optional redaction. The `v0.1.17` release includes the public-safe
`browsertrace export --public` mode, a packaged `browsertrace demo` command,
Browser Use/Stagehand/Skyvern/Playwright guides, and a no-dependency Browser
Use-shaped callback demo.

--json`, `browsertrace list --json`, and `browsertrace show <run_id> --json`
provide machine-readable diagnostics, while the local UI helps inspect the
failed browser step.

## Product Hunt Draft

Tagline:

```text
Local flight recorder for AI browser agents
```

Description:

```text
BrowserTrace records failed AI browser-agent runs locally: screenshots, URLs,
actions, model input/output, status, and errors. Open a step timeline, jump to
the first failed browser state, and export a standalone HTML trace with optional
redaction.
```

Maker comment:

```text
I built BrowserTrace because browser-agent failures are usually not explained by
logs alone. When a Browser Use, Stagehand, Skyvern, or Playwright + LLM run
fails, I want the screenshot, URL, action, model decision, and first error in
one local timeline.

The current release is intentionally small and OSS. The most useful feedback is:
what browser state do your current agent logs miss at failure time?
```

## console.dev Email Draft

Use this only from the owner's email account. console.dev features interesting
developer tools and beta releases; this is not a sponsored review request.

```text
To: hello@console.dev
Subject: Devtools suggestion: BrowserTrace

Hi console.dev team,

I wanted to suggest BrowserTrace for your developer tools queue.

BrowserTrace is an MIT-licensed local debugger for AI browser-agent runs. It
records each browser-agent step as a timeline with screenshot, URL, action,
model input/output, status, and error, then exports a standalone HTML trace
with optional redaction.

A concrete failure case: a Browser Use agent can see the right plus icon in a
screenshot, but click a nearby toolbar button because the tooltip text is not an
accessible name. BrowserTrace keeps the screenshot, URL, action, model decision,
and failed-step evidence together so that kind of bug can be inspected.

Another failure case: remote CDP state collection can hang while the websocket
still appears open, and event-bus lock timing can decide whether one stale
browser session blocks others. BrowserTrace is aimed at keeping that kind of
method timing, browser/session evidence, and failed-step context inspectable.

Why it may fit console.dev:
- It is interesting and useful to developers building Browser Use, Stagehand,
  Skyvern, Playwright + LLM, or custom computer-use agents.
- It can be a regular-use developer tool for investigating failed AI browser
  automation runs, especially when logs do not show what the agent saw.
- It is self-service: live demo, PyPI install, and no signup or sales call are
  required to try the local demo.
- It is local-first and open source, with a public-safe export path for sharing
  traces without prompts, screenshots, URLs, or model output.

Repo: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace

Comparison: https://aaronlab.github.io/browsertrace/compare-browser-agent-debugging.html
Public-safe demo export: https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/releases/download/v0.1.17/browsertrace-demo-public.html

This is not a sponsored review request. I would value any editorial feedback if
it is not a fit.
```

Do not ask for stars, votes, backlinks, or reciprocal placement. The ask is
only editorial consideration for a relevant developer tool.

Example use case: debugging a Browser Use run where the screenshot shows the
right plus icon, but the agent clicks a nearby toolbar button because tooltip
text is not an accessible name.

Second use case: diagnosing a remote-CDP browser-agent run where a browser state
collection request hangs while the websocket appears connected, so method
timing and browser/session evidence matter as much as the final timeout.

## Contribution Reply

If a directory reviewer or visitor asks how to make a small docs fix, point to
the good first issue label:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/labels/good%20first%20issue

Then share the First PR Recipe:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#first-pr-recipe keeps the first contribution small and reviewable.

If they say they want to work on an issue, acknowledge the claim and leave a
short claim window before implementing it yourself. If GitHub cannot assign
them, add the `claimed` label so the handoff is visible.

## Troubleshooting Reply

For local first-run issues, CI failures, or AI/coding-agent troubleshooting replies, ask for debugging/workflow details plus JSON CLI diagnostics when safe to share:

If the follow-up involves security-sensitive reports or changes, credentials,
or private trace data, route contributors to the
[Security Policy](https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
before they share details publicly.

```bash
browsertrace doctor --json
browsertrace list --status failed --json
browsertrace show <run_id> --json
```

## AOS Mapping Research

If a directory reviewer asks how BrowserTrace relates to OWASP AOS, keep the
answer research-only. BrowserTrace is not an AOS compliance claim yet. Current
research maps the closest BrowserTrace concepts to tool request/result records,
step correlation, URI-style screenshot/video artifacts, URL metadata, model I/O summaries,
and explicit redaction state.
