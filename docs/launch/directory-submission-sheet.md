## Try-It Commands

Before PyPI publishing is enabled, use the `uvx` path first in directory replies
when an editor asks how to try the project:

```bash
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace doctor
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace demo
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace list
uvx --from "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14" browsertrace
```

Persistent install from the GitHub release tag:

```bash
pip install "browsertrace[ui] @ git+https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace@v0.1.14"
browsertrace demo
browsertrace
```

## One-Line Pitch

BrowserTrace is a local flight recorder for AI browser agents: screenshots,
URLs, actions, model input/output, status, errors, and standalone HTML exports
for failed Browser Use, Stagehand, Skyvern, Playwright + LLM, and computer-use
runs.

## Short Submission Description

BrowserTrace is an MIT-licensed local debugger for AI browser agents. It records
each browser-agent step as a timeline with screenshot, URL, action, model
input/output, status, and error, then exports a standalone HTML trace with
optional redaction. The `v0.1.14` release includes the public-safe
`browsertrace export --public` mode, a packaged `browsertrace demo` command,
Browser Use/Stagehand/Skyvern/Playwright guides, and a no-dependency Browser
Use-shaped callback demo.

## Product Hunt Draft

Tagline:

```text
Local flight recorder for AI browser agents
```

Description:

```text
BrowserTrace records failed AI browser-agent runs locally: screenshots, URLs,
actions, model input/output, status, and errors. Open a step timeline, jump to
the first failed browser state, and export a standalone HTML trace with optional
redaction.
```

Maker comment:

```text
I built BrowserTrace because browser-agent failures are usually not explained by
logs alone. When a Browser Use, Stagehand, Skyvern, or Playwright + LLM run
fails, I want the screenshot, URL, action, model decision, and first error in
one local timeline.

The current release is intentionally small and OSS. The most useful feedback is:
what browser state do your current agent logs miss at failure time?
```

## Directory Pitch

Subject:

```text
BrowserTrace: local flight recorder for AI browser agents
```

Body:

```text
BrowserTrace is an MIT-licensed local debugger for AI browser agents.

It records each browser-agent step as a timeline with screenshot, URL, action,
model input/output, status, and error, then exports a standalone HTML trace with
optional redaction.

It is useful for Browser Use, Stagehand, Skyvern, Playwright + LLM scripts, and
custom computer-use agents.

## Contribution Reply

If a directory reviewer or visitor asks how to make a small docs fix, point to
the current good first issue:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/188

Then share the First PR Recipe:
https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#first-pr-recipe keeps the first contribution small and reviewable.

## Troubleshooting Reply

For local first-run issues, CI failures, or AI/coding-agent troubleshooting replies, ask for debugging/workflow details plus JSON CLI diagnostics when safe to share:

```bash
browsertrace doctor --json
browsertrace list --status failed --json
browsertrace show <run_id> --json
```

## Tracking

After each legitimate submission or post, append metrics:

```bash
uv run --python 3.11 python scripts/launch_metrics.py --append --note "after <target> submission: <URL or submitted>"
```

Also add the final submitted URL or note to issue #10:

https://github.com/aaronlab/browsertrace/issues/10
